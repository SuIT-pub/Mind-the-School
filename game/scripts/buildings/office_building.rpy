        Yeah, I know it's quite absurd. I only heard of ways to do it but I don't know how to do it.

        Well let's just forget that. Well for one we still have 3 potions.

        There was a letter with the potions and it says we can water it down to create more potions with a smaller 
        effect.

        I think if we water 2 potions down enough to serve every student in the school a small drink, then we could 
        create a good base to really influence every student.

        Do you think that works? Would there still be enough of an effect?

        Well I observed the school over the last week and as far as I could see, the students are not only prudish, 
        they are the abstinence in person.

        So I think the classical methods would not work until they are at least a little bit open to the idea sex.

        And without the potion or any other good working method we have no other way.

        So with the watered down potion we could open their minds and then start the real operation.

        And while we change the students, we could reopen the lab and work on reproducing the potion using the last 
        remaining as a draft.

        Please allow me to introduce myself as the new Headmaster of this institution as of Monday. 

        I am aware that many of you probably don't know me yet, but I hope to change that soon. 

        During my first week, I took time to gather information about the current status of the school, and it's clear 
        that there is much needed work to be done. 

        Rest assured, my goal is to get this school back on track and establish it as one of the leading academic 
        institutions in the country.
        
        My theory on how to improve the educational system has been criticised by established psychologists and 
        teachers. But I can guarantee the effectiveness.

        To give you a better understanding about me. 15 years ago I made my Diploma in Psychology, specifically 
        Educational Psychology. And over the last years I worked to revolotionize this countries educational system.

        My methods have yet to be accepted by the masses, but this is largely due to the conservative views of the 
        community and their unwillingness to change their habits and adapt to new approaches.

        To summarize my theory briefly. I aim to use the parts of the human body that no system every used. 
        
        The human body is a complex biological machine made to survive in a rough and dangerous ecosystem. So 
        originally it was built to learn new patterns and methods to give it a better chance at survival.

        Thus the human body handles informations and actions that seem to be of no use as unnecessary. And the human 
        body developed a relatively simple system to signal all kinds of information. Hormons.

        Hormons are used to deliver certain messages throughout the whole body. And I want to focus on the hormone 
        dopamine.

        Dopamine is one of the happy hormones and high concentrations of dopamine evoke a feeling of happiness. 
        Dopamine also helps transfer memories from short-term to long-term memory. And that is where my theory comes 
        into play.

        The easiest way to produce dopamine is to get intimate. Sure for some that sound like I try to just create a 
        giant harem school and sure there are other ways but I assure you my intentions are as sincere as they get and 
        I think this is a great opportunity to fix many problems that occur in our society.

        Problems that are the result of old educational methods and techniques.

        One of the main problems is the rising alienation of individuals in our society. Loneliness is becoming 
        increasingly prevalent, often due to social isolation caused by a lack of interpersonal skills and inadequate 
        support from the community.

        Unfortunately it's more that people unable to socialise become outcasts with little to no way to rehabilitate.

        My goal is to create a form of kinship and a deeper form of intimacy among the students. In a way that 
        emotional and physical support becomes the norm and to help people become more sociable and make it easier for 
        them to integrate into society.

        It was difficult to apply my theory in a big case study but the investors of this school complex reached out 
        to me and gave me the opportunity to show the effectiveness of this new method. And that will be achieved to
        make these schools the best in the country.

        If you want to learn more about my theory, please read my book. I'll happily distribute them to you if you're 
        interested.

        Of course I don't plan to run these schools alone. I wouldn't be able to handle that. That's why called this 
        group together so we can work to better these schools together!

        I plan to hold this meeting every friday in the evening so we can exchange ideas, talk about the current state 
        of the schools and discuss and vote for changes that are planned to be applied for the schools.

        To a good cooperation amd thank you all for listening.

        Now that I finished my {i}small{/i} introduction, please introduce yourself.
