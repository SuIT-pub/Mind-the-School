    scene expression "office/potion_intro_listen.png"

    char_Secretary "Hypnosis?"

    scene expression "office/potion_intro_listen.png"

    char_Principal "Well let's just forget that. Well for one we still have 3 potions."
    char_Principal "There was a letter with the potions and it says we can water it down to create more potions with a smaller effect."
    char_Principal "I think if we water 2 potions down enough to serve every student in the school a small drink, then we could create a good base to really influence every student."
    char_Secretary "Do you think that works? Would there still be enough of an effect?"
    char_Principal "Well I observed the school over the last week and as far as I could see, the students are not only prudish, they are the abstinence in person."
    char_Principal "So I think the classical methods would not work until they are at least a little bit open to the idea sex."
    char_Principal "And without the potion or any other good working method we have no other way."
    char_Principal "So with the watered down potion we could open their minds and then start the real operation."
    char_Principal "And while we change the students, we could reopen the lab and work on reproducing the potion using the last remaining as a draft."

    scene expression "office/potion_intro_45.png"
    char_Secretary "Okay let's do that!"
    char_Secretary "I think the best would be to distribute the diluted potion during recess."
    char_Principal "Yeah that sounds good, can I entrust that to you?"

    scene expression "office/potion_intro_44.png"
    char_Secretary "Of course! But there are still some problems."
    char_Principal "What do you mean?"
    char_Secretary "The regional representative visits the school every month to make sure the school follows national laws."

    scene expression "office/potion_intro_46.png"
    char_Secretary "We have to thank the old headmaster for that. So we have to be careful. He manages our monthly budget and es long as the school follows the rules we don't get budget cuts."
    char_Secretary "So we have to play the long game until we find a way to corrupt the department. The representatives change every month so corrupting one wouldn't help."

    scene expression "office/potion_intro_listen.png"
    char_Principal "Mhh you're right. I guess we have to be careful. But we can later think of a way to deal with them."
    char_Principal "I have to travel to the city. I have some thing to prepare. I'll be back tomorrow. You meanwhile distribute the potions. Can you make it happen by today's recess?"
