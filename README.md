This game concerns you, the new headmaster, of a former prestigious school. The old headmaster left it in a bad shape and now it is your job to bring the school back to its former glory. But how did you get to be the new headmaster? Well, you are known for your theory of intimate conditioning. You try to revolutionize the world and its people by creating the ultimate most intimate community. According to the motto: Make Love, not War. Of course, you're not just some perverted scum. Your theory of course has its roots in the biology of humans. But you'd have to lie if the change wouldn't also make you excited.
